Traditionally, diagnosing heart disease involves time-consuming processes, such as visiting doctors, undergoing medical tests, and reaching a consensus. Our system streamlines this process by automating the prediction of likelihood of heart disease in an individual. We propose an automated heart disease prediction and doctor recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The system aims to provide early detection and accurate risk assessment for individuals concerned about their heart health. By leveraging the power of machine learning, location-based information, and user ratings, our system offers an innovative approach to heart disease prediction and doctor recommendations.
Heart disease risk prediction is based on the Cleveland dataset, consisting of 13 attributes. Users provide 13 input attributes, and the prediction is performed using the SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier. The system predicts the risk of heart disease on a scale of 0-4, representing very low chance to very high chance.The system aims to provide personalized doctor recommendations based on the predicted risk of heart disease and user attributes. By identifying similar users through KNN, the system captures user similarities .Using SVD, the system predicts the ratings that similar users would assign to different doctors. This collaborative filtering approach allows the system to recommend doctors based on the collective experiences and opinions of similar users.To ensure convenience and accessibility, the system recommends the nearest highly rated doctors.
